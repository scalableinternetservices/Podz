# About

Team Podz is creating a platform for renting services and goods, including tools, gear, and transport.  A user of this service should be able to upload information about one or multiple items the user wishes to rent.  Another user should be able to, if the item is available, rent said item.  All items will fall into searchable categories, and users should be able to view top rented items from all categories.
